a transcribed conversation of a TV show, someday in 2004.

[17:01]
"Do you think becoming popular is necessary?" 

[17:02] 
"Yeah, I feel pointless to try master guitar. Like I feel like I need purpose but I don't want to chase popularity. But all I know musician are better to be known, and so what's the point? I can't make my own song anyway because I lack of ability to express my own feelings into any form of art."

[17:05] 
"The feel of playing... I want to make my guitar sing. But again, I feel like there's no point in that. What I do won't make me money anyway."

[17:07] 
"I have a goal that I just realised yesterday actually. I feel alive when [I'm] playing guitar even though I don't write or sing for myself because i'm not good with words from myself. But I notice some people that are actually deeply care about how themselves feel often have a hard time in expressing it. [I] feel like I want to help them. With the musical knowledge I have, I feel like I want to help them express what they feel in song, with my little help. I want to do that. That could be my goal. But to offer that maybe a little bit hard since I'm not easily open to people either."

[17:10] 
"Yes, one or two people in my friendship group. But I don't know how to help them, [they] seemed like not an artistic type of person, or at least I don't know it yet. So to ask them—what about try to turn it into music?—question is maybe a little bit too much for them knowing that I am the only one in the group that into music so much."

[17:14] 
"Something warm—You know, after I listen to some of George Harrison's songs, what I feel very different is that his songs, even though it made after a sadness cause or anything, the tone is warm, and the lyrics is comforting. Sometimes cheering mood up, sometimes giving warmth. For me that never likes any mellow type of beat, [it] kinda surprises me that those kind of music really exists."
