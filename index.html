I love music.
            
imagine a chain smoker, but with music. addicted to music. can't have a day without "smoking" a playlist.
I'm an addict. I'm a nerd of music.
if I ever lick an album, I would always know everything about each track of it.

when listening to music, I don't go with the vibe nor lyrics first. I digest the composition, the arrangement. I sort the drums, I sort the guitar, I sort the bass, I sort the harmonising vocals. then followed by vibe, lyrics last.
I think this is my way of listening because I was into producing songs before. thus my brain got its own default processing method to music.

I never really cared about lyrics. no song ever carried my feeling away. I'm hardly get swayed of anything, but a song, The Beatles made. last ever song they'd release back in 2023. I cried over that song, even by the 5th time of listening to it. powerful. I've got it in my heart, and nothing (in context of entertainment media) ever made me cry.

my favourite musician and guitarist (I'd say more like my guitarist hero) died 5 years before I was born. and I'm glad discovering it by the age of 19, 24 years after his death. I'm also glad I didn't born earlier before his death because I might would've feel devastated by his death.

six months before discovering my favourite guitarist, I bought my first ever musical instrument. local branded electric guitar. white pick guarded red stratocaster. very cheap one. I chose that colour after seeing Murdoc Niccal's flying V bass guitar on "Clint Eastwood" promotional music video.

I started playing guitar in the age of 17. but hadn't own any musical instrument yet until 18. but I've known a lot of music theory since I was 14. so picking up a guitar isn't a difficult thing for me. 

my guitarist hero sparked his spark in the age of 20. I feel insecure that I accomplish less than my favourite. but I guess life is not always have to be like what we want because not everything we want is what we need. though now I'm stuck in a place and with people that I didn't purely wish I was part of it.

I wish time would take me somewhere. it's God's plan.
